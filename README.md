# Tarkov-Set-Default-Volume
This is an AutoHotkey script that automaticaly sets a specific system volume once you launch Escape From Tarkov.
This aims to fix inconsistent volume levels of different sound volume options in Tarkov once the main volume has been changed in Tarkov.
This script alows you to leave the ingame sound volume at 100%, and automalticaly set your system volume to a desired level on game launch, so you can hear everything in game in a volume comfortable for you.
This script at the same time saves your original system volume before game launch, and resets to original after the game is closed.
